Dublin cycling officer loses job after funding cut,"He said there were ""more trips made every day in Dublin by bicycle than Luas"" and it was ""really important that we have a cycling officer"" who could challenge the mindset of roads engineers.

He strongly warns against choosing a cheap lock, saying that most cable-style locks can be relatively easily snipped with bolt cutters, while cheaper models will pop open when a thief pulls a bike hard against them. ""We know some teenagers or young men are walking around the city and looking at parked bikes, to see how expensive they look and how they are locked up. If it's a cheap lock, a good hard pull might pop it open. We've actually seen cases so opportunist that two young lads on bikes will stop at other chained-up bikes, and if one of them manages to rob a better bike than the one he is already on, he'll leave his own bike at the scene and go off on the stolen one.""

Cycling the sights in Cisco,"I'D BEEN TOLD that San Francisco is a cyclists' city, but it was only when I hopped on the saddle and began my first descent that I realised how truly steep the San Francisco slopes are.

Before I continue, let me tell you that I'm a Leitrim girl. Better still, I'm a cycling Leitrim girl. I'm used to hills. I'm happy on hills (mostly). But what's missing from the bracing slopes of the northwest is a steady stream of traffic coming at you in 10-second interludes. From the wrong side of the road. In bizarre one way systems. With tram lines spaced precariously, just waiting to trap your front wheel and leave you stuck in the firing line of an iconic San Francisco cable car. What better way to begin a San Francisco cycling holiday than a spin over the Golden Gate Bridge? I began at Fisherman's Wharf. From the touristy enclave I made my way along the waterfront, past the imposing structures at Fort Mason, stopping at the farmer's market for beautiful fresh juice and bread.

""But I'm not keen on making people think it's an activity you have to have a lot of gear to do. In France, we don't wear helmets because cycling is so normal that it would feel strange to put special equipment on. Cycling is easy and it's safe.""

Snowfall and cold front send cyclists and temperatures tumbling in Beijing: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION],"This was the week of crashing bicycles in Beijing. After a rare snowfall we were hit by a blistering cold front from Siberia which drove temperatures down to minus 16C and turned the snow on the streets into lethal sheets of shiny black ice. One second an office worker or shop assistant would be sailing by on a bicycle; the next moment, bike and passenger would be lying in a tangled, skidding heap. The egg and fruit sellers on the little market street near us had an entertaining couple of days, as bicycles slid wildly from under their riders on a particularly deceptive stretch of roadway. Knots of pedestrians gathered to watch as the usually docile Phoenix and Flying Pigeon machines staged suicidal rebellions, their handlebars writhing uncontrollably and throwing the sedate owners on to the road. It wasn't so much fun, of course, for the 6,000 casualties who were taken to the Jishuitan hospital emergency room and other hospitals from all over Beijing with arm and leg fractures.

Increased investment in recent years in a 300 km network of cycle-lanes around the city would eventually encourage more people to use bicycles as a means of transport. Mr Keegan said an exclusive reliance on improving cycling infrastructure ""does not work"". While the public had accepted and were often enthusiastic about improvements in pedestrian and bus facilities, this was not the case with cycling infrastructure.",309851838,"Jun 2, 2005",Irish Times,2005, 3
End of the road in sight for endangered city cyclist,"As John Henry, Dublin Transportation Office chief executive, admitted yesterday, the design of many of these tracks left much to be desired. The first cycle tracks required cyclists to dismount at every junction, a layout Mr Henry described as ""wacky"". There are plenty of examples at this week's Velo-City conference of how other cities are taking radical steps to improve the safety and attractiveness of cycling. Denis Baupin, transport mayor of Paris, told delegates cars took up a ""barbaric"" amount of space in his city. A huge increase in bike lanes and extra-wide bus lanes, contraflow lanes for cyclists, a virtual ban on cars entering some central areas and a network of bike rental shops are among the measures now being introduced in Paris, according to Mr Baupin.",309854857,"Jun 1, 2005",Irish Times,2005, 3
Cyclists must be treated as integral part of urban traffic,"Nowhere has the NRA's approach to road design been so perfected as when designing interchanges of radial roads crossing the M50. Travelling on the N4 from Lucan, one is faced with a series of slip roads and huge multi-lane roundabouts. In effect the N4 is treated as a motorway, with no need to consider the needs of cyclists and pedestrians. When cyclists recently raised these safety issues, the NRA retort was ""no one is forcing you to cycle that route"". Heavy Goods Vehicles: Of the 21 cyclists killed in Dublin over the past seven years, 16 (78 per cent) were killed by HGVs. Put simply HGVs and cities don't mix. While the opening of the port tunnel will alleviate the problem, nothing has been done in the interim to remove the danger posed by HGVs - no restriction on the time they can enter the city, no banning of super HGVs, no mandatory fitting of additional mirrors. What is needed is a national policy to ban HGVs from city centres and residential areas, and prevent HGVs ""rat-running"" through towns to avoid motorway tolls.",309862999,"May 31, 2005",Irish Times,2005, 18

Seat-belts a danger to pedestrians and cyclists,"Risks can be divided into three categories - directly perceptible risks, risks perceptible only with the aid of science, and virtual risks. Directly perceptible risks include things such as climbing trees, riding a motorcycle, and so on. Risks perceptible with the aid of science include infectious diseases. Virtual risks are those about which scientists cannot agree on their nature or magnitude. Suspected carcinogens fall into this category. I only have space to deal with directly perceptible risks in this article. Each of us has an individual propensity to take risks and this can vary a lot from one person to another - for example this propensity is likely to differ significantly between a member of Hell's Angels and a school principal. In particular situations this individual propensity to take risks is modified by one's perception of the balance between the reward associated with the risk (e.g. drive faster and arrive sooner) and one's perception of the danger involved and of the probability of an accident occurring. We have evolved mechanisms to self-manage directly perceived risks. We automatically evaluate directly perceived hazards and individually decide how to handle them in a way that is the most comfortable for us given our propensity to take risks, our perceived rewards and our assessment of the risk and severity of accident. Central authority tries to reduce risk by providing structurally safe roads and by imposing various legally backed restrictions on our driving. Most people react to the restrictions with risk- compensation behaviour and consequently road accident statistics remain stubbornly high.",309812400,"Sep 9, 2004",Irish Times,2004, 17

"Cyclists should throw their hat at the idea of compulsory safety helmets ; The only proven effect of helmet laws elsewhere has been to discourage significant numbers of people from cycling, writes Shane Foran: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Well, for a start, taken in the public health context cycling is demonstrably the safest form of transport. According to the British Medical Association, the health benefits of regular cycling significantly outweigh any disbenefits through injury. In Denmark, adult cycle commuters show a 40 per cent lower mortality than their non-cycling peers. This effect has been attributed to various factors, but the key issue is that both cycle-helmet compulsion and promotion are proven failures as means of promoting cyclist safety. For Ireland, imposing a cycle-helmet law, whose only proven effect is to cut cyclist numbers, would be public health folly. Isn't there still merit in promoting helmets? Well, designing a cycle helmet is a non-trivial technical challenge. A cyclist's safety in traffic relies on unobstructed vision and hearing. Any helmet must not hamper these senses or hinder the free movement of the head. Therefore there can be no equivalence between motorcycle and cycling helmets.",309744503,"Jun 2, 2004",Irish Times,2004, 16

"Can cycling cure gridlock? ; We once cycled a lot. Today bicycles seem an obvious way to beat congestion. So how can we make them appealing and, more importantly, safe? James Nix writes: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Cycling advocates eye with approval the tax-free public- transport tickets that employers can buy for their staff. Employees can save up to 48 per cent of the normal fare; employers save up to 10.75 per cent on PRSI contributions. A similar scheme, allowing employers to pay their staff's bike bills - with provision for a mileage allowance - would undoubtedly boost the number of people cycling to work. Unfortunately, tax changes will not redress the slump in cycling to school. Here, VAT reform would work better. Do we know what has dented cycling's popularity? In 1961, in the 12 hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., nearly 100,000 bicycles crossed Dublin's canals each day. Ten years later this had fallen to 20,000 - the seeds of the decline in cycling set in long before the 1980s. If these figures are a clue to national trends, then the 1960s saw thousands leave their bikes at home. During the 1960s and 1970s a generation of lapsed cyclists began to rear children, and cycling has declined since. (Inside its canals, Dublin managed to stabilise cycling in the mid-1990s - but there has been no rise since - and suburban Dublin appears at one with national trends.)",309693468,"Feb 3, 2004",Irish Times,2004, 15

"Frailties evident in grande dame of cycling ; William Fotheringham looks at the many and growing problems facing the Tour and how it is losing touch with its roots, the rural poor: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Once over, each Tour de France boils down to a set of images, snapshots in the mind. This year is no exception: Joseba Beloki lying on the road near Gap as if he had dropped from the sky; Lance Armstrong jumping over a ditch with his bike on his shoulder; Tyler Hamilton's grimace; sparks flying from Jan Ullrich's bike as he hit the tarmac in Nantes. The connection between the Tour and la France profonde remains as strong as ever. Few sporting events are so rooted in place. The interest of the wider world grows annually too. The strength of the 100-year-old grande dame of cycling is in no doubt, but most centenarians have a fragility about them too and the Tour is no exception. What was striking about this Tour was that it returned to the big cities which hosted the stage finishes of the first race in 1903 - Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Nantes - and it was a salutary experience. Apart from Bordeaux and Paris, the Tour now rarely visits the huge centres, and this year's race showed why. The race does not take over a city as it does a medium-sized provincial centre such as Albi. Apart from in Nantes, the Tour felt pushed to the margins, particularly in Toulouse, where the finish was shunted off to an airfield to which few of the public turned up.",309610495,"Jul 29, 2003",Irish Times,2003, 21

As this year&#39;s Tour de France builds to its climax, Watson talks to Shane Stokes about his life and work: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","[Graham Watson] went to see Eddy Merckx's last Tour de France in 1977 and took several photographs at the race. One of those won him a competition held by Cycling Weekly magazine, solidifying his growing passion and opening doors into the sport. Now, 26 years on, Watson is one of the most respected names in the business and spends a huge part of his year on the back of a motorbike, taking pictures of some of the world's best athletes in one of the world's toughest sports. Using equipment valued at (pounds) 35,000, Watson's many hours haring around mountain bends and racing over slippery cobblestones have resulted in a highly-acclaimed portfolio, some of which was shown at an exhibition held in Temple Bar during the start of the 1998 Tour de France in Dublin. Since the retirement of [Sean Kelly] and [Stephen Roche], Ireland has had little presence on the world stage. However, Watson is encouraged by the pro debut this year of former world junior champion Mark Scanlon, a 22-year-old from Sligo. ""Mark is very good, a big prospect.

""Grilling the ravito"", as cycling slang has it, is strictly a no-no. Not riding dangerously is the most obvious, although the sprinters interpret that one extremely loosely. If the ravito is sacrosanct, so are the collective moments when a large group of riders - usually led by the yellow jersey of the day - collectively decide to suspend hostilities on a quiet stretch of roadside and empty their bladders.

In theory, Chinese drivers should be among the best in the world - and the traffic system the safest. We've heard lots about penalty points in Ireland recently and have hailed the fact that the number of road deaths has dropped since their introduction. Well, surprisingly, Beijing has boasted a penalty points system for the past decade. The system punishes drivers who err for any traffic violation, and, in some cases, this means that they must sit their driving tests again.

""If you have done a few races, you know it's not as dangerous as it appears to be,"" he says. ""On paper, it does sound a lot more dangerous than it actually is. If someone was badly hurt during a race, it would more than likely be the kind of accident that could happen to anyone - not because you are racing.

At Ceannt station in Galway, Iarnrd ireann offers, on the one hand, the cheapest all-day parking in Galway city - E4 per day - while, on the other, it fails to provide any bicycle parking at the station. Dublin's Heuston station upgrade involves the downgrading of bicycle parking, with all protests on the issue falling on deaf ears. Dublin first participated in the event in 2000. Despite a good public reaction, the initial event was not built upon. Just how out of step Dublin is with other European capitals was highlighted during last year's event.

Nigerian cycling club hopes for visas U-turn: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION],"Members of a Nigerian cycling club who have been refused entry visas to take part in an international cycle race which starts in Dublin on Sunday are hoping that a last-minute appeal will succeed. The race's organiser, Mr Dermot Dignam, said he received an e- mail from the secretary of the cycling team in March requesting an invitation to the competition. The secretary subsequently forwarded euro 1,800 to Mr Dignam for accommodation deposits for the team. At that time, Mr Dignam wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Cowen, asking for his support for the team's visa applications. He wrote that the cyclists' participation would ""help overcome negative racial attitudes"" and benefit Irish-Nigerian relations. Mr Dignam yesterday appealed to the Department to reverse its original decision to refuse the visas.",309449588,"May 14, 2002",Irish Times,2002, 3
Cycling to step up random testing for EPO: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION],"Cycling: In a response to requests from teams and individual riders, the International Cycling Union (UCI) has promised to step up out-of-competition drug testing for EPO and other banned performance boosters, writes Shane Stokes. UCI president Hein Verbruggen has said that the average hematocrit (red blood cell) level in the peloton last season was measured at 44 per cent, a level which suggests that EPO use is diminishing. Previously, a 50 per cent cut-off limit was regarded as pointing to probable use of the banned hormone, which acts by stimulating red cell production in the body and thus enhancing stamina. Hockey: Three Rock Rovers, the Leinster Under-16 Cup holders, gained third place in the prestigious HOD international tournament in Eindhoven.

"How the Abbey theatre really began ; Tomorrow is the centenary of a humble production in St Teresa&#39;s Temperance Hall which led to the founding of the Abbey. Toms Mac Anna pays tribute to Maud Gonne, Annie Horniman, Frank Fay - and Willie Fay, who searched Dublin on his bicycle for a location for the new theatre: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","When Lady Gregory died in 1932, quite a controversy arose over who were the real founders of the Abbey Theatre. [Annie Fredericka Horniman] in Manchester insisted that she was the one and not Lady Gregory or even Yeats. Several others chimed in, notably the northern playwright, St John Ervine who supported Horniman's claim, maintaining that no native southerner could possibly have had a hand in it, and the brothers Willie and [Frank Fay] were hardly mentioned at all. In just two years' time the old place will be celebrating its centenary and despite the rumours of its intended flitting to other and varied locations, will still be there at the corner of Marlborough Street and Abbey for the festive occasion. The centenary of the venture that led to the founding of the Irish National Theatre Society, which owns and runs the theatre to the present day, is tomorrow. On April 2nd, 1902, the two Fay brothers, Willie and Frank, assembled a company of amateur players, called themselves W. G. Fay's National Dramatic Company and presented two plays at the Saint Teresa's Temperance Hall in Clarendon Street, Deirdre by the poet and mythic, George Russell (AE) and Kathleen Ni Houlihan by W.B. Yeats (the authorship of this work is disputed, with some claiming that much of it was written by Lady Gregory; however any actor who ever acted in it will confirm it was written by Yeats). It was neither Yeats nor Gregory who brought it about, however, but the redoubtable [Maud Gonne], hoping to raise funds for her organisation, Inghinidhe na hEireann, though she has seldom been given credit for it. Yeats wanted her to appear in his one-act play, Kathleen Ni Houlihan. She went to the Fay brothers, who had already assembled a company of players intending to take over from the Irish Literary Theatre - with Irish actors for a change, instead of the English professionals preferred by its founders, Yeats and Edward Martyn. The Fays had helped Maud and her Daughters of Erin girls several times before, producing pageants and tableaux for them to fund their nationalistic activities.",309465687,"Apr 1, 2002",Irish Times,2002, 10

Dr Potterton and her bicycle went under the front wheels of the cab of the truck, witnesses said. She was found to have died from multiple injuries and in particular, severe head injuries. The inquest heard that trucks need to make a very wide-angled turn at the junction to avoid their trailers mounting the footpath. Mr Patrick Flannery, the truck driver, said at no point had he seen the cyclist on his inside before or as he made the left turn. A Garda public service vehicle (PSV) inspector who examined the truck and the bicycle after the accident, agreed with Mr Joseph Durkan, for the Potterton family, that because of the position of indicators on the truck cab, a cyclist would not have any idea whether a truck was turning left if he or she was on the inside in line with the cab.",309431796,"Jan 24, 2002",Irish Times,2002, 9

"Paradise found ; Sunbathing, reading, cycling, swimming and dining out. It&#39;s a hard life on Kos, but Tony Clayton-Lea just about copes: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Although the Dodecanese means 12 islands, there are many more. About 20 are inhabited, with countless islets bereft of human life. Kos is one of the prettiest- according to Greek legend a blessed place and known in ancient times as fruitful, fertile and sweet- smelling. Its name is said to have come from a variety of sources: from the Carian word koion, meaning sheep (because the shape of the island once resembled a sheep's head); or the meaning of an enclosure or a crab; or from the ancient Princess Kos, daughter of King Mempas II. The most strenuous thing we did was to hire out bikes for a coup1eof days.Resisting the temptation just to look at them, we made two forays into Kos terrain. The first was to the tiny resort village of Thermes, 13 kilometres from Kos town. It has a medicinal hydrotherapy spring used in the treatment of rheumatism and arthritis, and is undoubtedly the hottest water outside a piping bath I've ever wallowed in. The second bicycling adventure was to the Asklepeio. The greatest archaeological site on the island, the Asklepeio is believed to be the earliest hospital the ancient world can boast of. The Asklepeio of Kos became famous thanks to the skill and wisdom of Hippocrates, father of medicine and founder of the world's first school of medicine on the island. It's a three-terraced site with discernible altars, quarters, colonnades and patients' rooms. The view of Kos town from the uppermost third terrace is spectacular, and we stayed there reading for a while, occasionally glancing up over the parapet to look at Kos shimmering in the distance.",309408184,"Jan 26, 2002",Irish Times,2002, 75

"Corporation has little control of roadworks ; Dublin Corporation is indeed responsible for maintaining roads in the capital and keeping them safe for cyclists. But it can&#39;t stop utility companies digging them up, writes Owen Keegan: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Ms [Karlin Lillington] correctly identifies the poor state of the city's road network as a serious problem for cyclists and other roadusers. However, it is unfair to assign all the blame for this unsatisfactory state of affairs to Dublin Corporation. While the corporation is responsible for maintaining the road network, there is a major problem with roadworks being carried out on behalf of utilities (including telecoms operators). The simple fact is that the corporation does not have adequate power to control these works and to ensure that standards are maintained. These problems have become especially acute in recent years with the proliferation of telecoms operators laying fibre-optic networks throughout the city following the liberalisation of that sector. Ms Lillington is clearly opposed to shared bus/cycle lanes. She ignores the reality that at many locations in the city the space simply does not exist to provide dedicated cycle lanes. I believe that a shared bus/cycle lane is better than no provision at all for cyclists. She is also highly critical of the standard of cycle lanes in the city. While I accept that some of the earlier cycle lanes left a lot to be desired, the standard has improved dramatically and the older sub-standard cycle lanes are being upgraded. Ms Lillington enters very dangerous territory when appearing to suggest that no blame at all should attach to roadusers even where they engage in inappropriate or dangerous behaviour. She states: "". . . the real problem is not that walkers often cross streets before lights favour them, or that cyclists (legally) move up inside of vehicles at intersections, or that drivers turn without signalling and cut off cyclists. Poorly-designed and neglected streets force all three groups into frequent and unsafe contact.""",309412834,"Nov 14, 2001",Irish Times,2001, 16

"Shifting into a higher gear Shane Stokes looks at the career of German rider Jan Ullrich, winner of the 1997 Tour, as he prepares for a potentially enthralling battle with America&#39;s Lance Armstrong for the biggest prize in cycling: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","Rebuilding. It is four years from that day in Andorra and things haven't quite gone to plan. [Bernard Hinault] was just one of many experts who predicted a succession of victories, but instead the so-called Tourminator faltered under the pressure of new-found stardom. Calling a halt to his 1997 season shortly after that Tour win was a warning sign. Becoming increasingly reclusive and amid heightened speculation that all was not right, a bloated [Jan Ullrich] emerged for the new season 12 kilos overweight. Hinault et al were quick to change their tack. ""If Ullrich arrived in Dublin ready for the Tour, I'll take my hat off to him,"" the Frenchman proclaimed dismissively. Meanwhile, [Lance Armstrong] had emerged as the new dominant force in world cycling. The Texan recovered from testicular cancer to win both the 1999 and 2000 Tours, ironically seizing the titles in a manner almost identical to Ullrich's victory. Both strong time triallists, both all-rounders suited to three-week stage races, the parallels extend yet further. When Armstrong took gold in the professional world championships in Oslo in 1993, the then 19-year- old German won the amateur crown. And both saw their fathers walk out of their lives at an early age, a factor which some feel has cultivated their huge ambition. There is a crucial difference between two - discipline. While Ullrich's past three seasons have been a tale of rushed preparation, Armstrong has been meticulous in his approach. Reaching the Tour in immaculate condition is the priority and so the 29-year-old spends weeks training over the climbs of the Tour each spring. He goes as far as to weigh his food, calculating exact calorific requirements so that he starts the Tour with a minimum of body fat. ""Bulimic in his appetite, anorexic in appearance,"" wrote a French journalist last year. The difference is Armstrong's hunger is for success rather than more customary sustenance.",309403049,"Jul 7, 2001",Irish Times,2001, 57

They meander over kerbs and across people's driveways, pedestrians walk on them, and steel signposts stuck into the cycle path mean a moment's inattention could result in a fatal collision. And crucially, most major thoroughfares lack any lanes at all: Dame Street, Westmoreland Street, O'Connell Street, Dorset Street, Baggot Street, and 99 per cent of the quays.",309397655,"Oct 31, 2001",Irish Times,2001, 14
"On yer bike To launch our new Commuter Belt column, Mary Russell, long-time cycling advocate, celebrates the joy of a pair of wheels: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION]","People cycling to work may be sitting on their saddles but they're certainly not sitting on their brains. Call me anti-car but there's no machine that will get you to your urban destination - workplace, school or shop - faster than the bike. Cycling is building-friendly (no exhaust fumes damaging homes as well as lovely, old, historic buildings); it's people-friendly (no fumes to give you and your child asthma); it's cheap (no travel expenses, no parking fees or tickets and you generate your own dynamo light) and, like Muhammad Ali, it's so quick you're there before you leave. And if anyone complains that cyclists don't pay road tax, my answer is that, on the contrary, they should get something back for not adding to the cost of healthcare and of cleaning up the environment. Having spent most of this summer in Oxford, I've found lots of commuters loading their bikes on the shuttle train to London - free of charge, Iarnrd ireann, please note. I've used this service, and believe me, there's no greater pleasure than cycling across Hyde Park on a sunny September morning, sun glistening on the Serpentine, horses ambling along Rotten Row and cyclists with their own wide cycle track all to themselves. In fact, by using the parks and the Embankment, you can cover quite a lot of London without ever coming in contact with traffic. Irish cities are another matter but some city fathers are waking up to the usefulness of cycle paths. There are few countries where I have not been able to cycle. Algiers, with its hills, was a bit of struggle. Edinburgh too was challenging, for the same reason. Maastricht was a dream, as is the whole of the Netherlands, where the cyclist is well catered for. Even in the old part of Maastricht, among cobbled streets too narrow to allow cycle lanes, bikers and pedestrians all share the same space without undue rancour, unlike Oxford where there is a campaign against cyclists using the pavements regardless of the width, the time of day or night or the presence of pedestrians on them.",309398074,"Sep 7, 2001",Irish Times,2001, 13

Any further abuse of the cyclist is therefore done with full intent, and constitutes a criminal offence that should be investigated by police. Finally, and though it might not be obvious, being courteous on the roadway still helps. Waiting one's turn at a traffic signal, avoiding moving up on the left of cars that are signalling for a left turn, and offering a ""Thank you!"" wave to motorists who let a cyclist into the traffic flow or who make efforts to overtake safely go a long way toward making a better day for cyclist and motorist.",309377577,"Aug 20, 2001",Irish Times,2001, 15

My God, the stiffness, the blisters, the bruises, the pains in every twisted muscle, the crashes against the chalk road that I have endured."" ""I am not thoroughly convinced yet,"" he told her, ""that I was not killed. Anybody but a vegetarian would have been. Nobody but a teetotaller would have faced a bicycle again for six months."" In his memoirs, [Bertrand Russell], whom Shaw of course blamed, added a prologue that Shaw seems to have forgotten: ""He got up completely unhurt and continued his ride; whereas my bicycle was smashed and I had to return by train. It was a very slow train, and at every station Shaw, with his bicycle, appeared on the platform, put his head into the carriage and jeered.

Innovation in electric bicycles,"The electric bike is environmentally friendly - powered by batteries which don't contribute to the yellow haze of pollution casting a pall over most Chinese cities. They can travel around 100km on a full charge, more than enough for a day's cycling. And they're convenient, with many apartment buildings have areas where bikers can plug in their ""e-bikes"" overnight to charge. And they cost around a tenth of the cost of a pair of pants. A statement from the traffic management authority in Beijing's Yizhuang district is typical of the official view. ""Many electric-powered bicycles don't have number plates and so cyclists can escape after committing hit-and-run accidents,"" the traffic management division said. The proposals require electric bicycle users to pass driving tests, get insurance and do annual check-ups on the vehicle by the traffic management authorities. ""With this rule,"" wrote one of China's leading writers, Han Han, ""the majority of the electric bikes will be classified as mopeds or electric motorcycles. The owners will have to pay a lot for licenses and taxes. Electric bikes are silent, with poor braking performance. A lot of electric vehicles are able to run at 50km/h.

Cyclists unite - you have nothing to lose but your chains,"'WHEN I see an adult on a bicycle"", wrote HG Wells, ""I no longer despair for the human race."" When asked to choose the world's most important inventions since 1800, three in five respondents to a BBC radio poll picked the bicycle. Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey clearly thinks so. His department published the first ever National Cycle Framework Policy (NCFP) earlier this year. Dempsey aims to have 10 per cent of all commuting done by bike in 2020. What's equally clear is that a multiplicity of factors killed off the bike, and only what the NCFP calls ""strong interventions"" can reverse these. Probably the biggest obstacle towards cycling is the attitude of some other road users. Impatience and lack of awareness on the part of drivers (including so-called professionals such as bus and taxi drivers) greatly adds to the sense of hazard for cyclists. In Scandinavia and Germany, a ""hierarchy of care"" places the onus on motorists to drive cautiously around vulnerable road users. After all, cyclists don't kill truckers, so the legal duty of care must reflect this inequality of risk.",309185473,"Jul 9, 2009",Irish Times,2009, 13

""The goals are about half the size of soccer goals and the ball is bigger than a tennis ball - it's about the size of a grapefruit - and the mallet is 30 inches [12cm] long, with a teak head,"" explains Connon. ""It's a great game and it's open to everyone irrespective of age or gender - we have one guy playing, Peter Matthews, who's 71,"" he says. ""We have a couple of women playing as well - we play on Thursday evenings and Sunday mornings at the Phoenix Park in Dublin.""",309154922,"Jul 23, 2009",Irish Times,2009, 16
Even relentless fighter now sees cycling as a lost cause,"""He's thinks now that the drugs he took may be related. But I don't think anything Fignon was on is related to cancer. I mean, he was on the baby aspirin. It was always a wink, or a joke, at dinner table. 'Can't wait 'till the Tour is over, and we don't have to feel pain anymore'. The problem was the criterion races, which came after. They were all fixed, and kind of disgusting. But they were even more painful, because you're racing flat out. It could be seen as just personal. Except it's not. It's about business. It's about fighting for what you believe in. [Greg LeMond] started his own bicycle company in 1990, then two years later signed a deal with Trek. They would manufacture and distribute the bikes and sell them under LeMond's name. But by 2001, when LeMond raised his concerns about [Michele Ferrari], by far the biggest name on Trek's books was [Lance Armstrong]. LeMond, under pressure, retracted, but the fall-out was only beginning. Eight years later it's headed for the courts; LeMond claims Armstrong, as a way of getting back, was responsible for Trek's neglect of his line of bikes, which ended the deal completely last year. ""Because of what happened to me as a kid, the abuse, I was trying to please everyone. Trying to do the right thing. Maybe some people thought I was naive. But it's the same with the riders right now. I know they don't want to be doing this. They're like lab rats. That's why I've likened it to somebody who is being abused.

Plans to encourage more cyclists,"First, in the development of safe cycling infrastructure, there is a big difference between ""cycle lanes with visual segregation"" and ""physically separated cycle tracks"". I cycle to and from work each day in Dublin and I have just returned from a trip to Munich where I hired a bicycle to cycle around the city. The difference between cycling in the two cities could not be more stark. In Germany cycle lanes are amply provided and well-maintained, whereas in Ireland facilities for cyclists are strewn with shards of glass (because the roads are rarely cleaned) and littered with potholes (because the roads are poorly maintained). No doubt the members of the Cabinet are unable to see these facts because of the restricted view from their ministerial cars. Madam, - I was very interested to read in your edition of April 21st about the Government's plans to encourage cycling - all of which are very laudable - but what surprised me greatly was that two photographs with the article showed cyclists without helmets. Given the real dangers facing cyclists, many of whom sustain brain injuries when involved in accidents, I think this practice is as unacceptable as driving without a seat belt. It is also disappointing not to see any reference in the article to the need to encourage cyclists to wear helmets at all times. - Yours, etc,",309140885,"Apr 23, 2009",Irish Times,2009, 17

A lecturer in TCD, he attended the funeral of [Zu Zhang Wong] and received the permission of his parents and his cousin, who lives in Ireland. McKillen's personal motivation to highlight the dangers facing cyclists in Dublin, especially from lorries, began when he came upon an accident in September 2006. A trained first aider, he went to help. ""The cyclist was under the truck. I started giving CPR, as I knelt in the gutter with rainwater coursing down. I did the breathing. Another passer-by did chest compression. The man died in my arms one minute after we started."" McKillen believes that six-axle trucks and other big lorries such as concrete mixers are not designed for urban traffic-congested environments, even when fisheye or Cyclops mirrors are fitted (to allow the driver see what is happening on the passenger side). He argues that the view of the driver is still obstructed.

Vital battle still raging for the soul of cycling,"[Lance Armstrong]'s book seems to represent many things for athletes trying to tap into their deepest reserves of inner strength and resolve. Armstrong's story has passed into modern sports lore: he not only battled back from the bleakest cancer diagnosis to return to full fitness, he then went on to obliterate all previous cycling form by winning the Tour de France in seven consecutive years, between 1999 and 2005. It was a feat deemed superhuman, even in a sport where the boundaries of ordinary human capability often seem stretched. [Paul Kimmage]'s question was fairly straightforward if somewhat provocative: he asked the illustrious champion why he stood by [Floyd Landis] and [Ivan Basso] when they had neither admitted nor apologised for their transgressions? Armstrong, though, had his own axe to grind. After confirming Kimmage's identity, he went on the attack over a line that he contended Kimmage had written. , He stated: ""You said 'Folks, the cancer has been in remission for four years but our cancer has now returned.' Meaning me."" Whether or not it was appropriate for Paul Kimmage to refer to Armstrong in the terms he did is a matter of individual opinion. The inference may well, as Armstrong intimated during his measured tirade, offend people around the world who have been affected in some way and by some strain of the killer illness. But it is also true Armstrong, from the moment he published that best-selling book, has linked his battles with the illness to his subsequent glories. He is the most vivid living proof imaginable that such illnesses can be beaten and has become one of the most high-profile charity fund-raisers on the high-end charity scene to which many retired sports stars devote their time.",309124581,"Feb 21, 2009",Irish Times,2009, 10

City cyclists get a rough deal,"I moved from Galway to Dublin in 1992 and have been cycling on a daily basis since. There are hazards and downsides to cycling in the capital. Strangely enough, the weather isn't one of them. The Green Party's Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, owned a cycling tour company before becoming a politician, and he always comes out with the line that Dublin is a drier city than Amsterdam (which is one of the most cycle-friendly cities in the world, along with Copenhagen and Paris). It rains badly enough to dissuade you on only eight days every year, he argues. Let it be quickly added that this sad, sodden, miserable deluge of a year has been an exception to the Ryan rule. All of the above makes cycling seem unremittingly unattractive in Dublin or the major urban centre. That's not quite the case. It's a quick, easy, healthy and green way of getting around the city. I know exactly how long it will take me to get from A to B. I can go places without spending 20 minutes searching for parking. When it rains, I wear a Goretex raincoat, pull-ups and galoshes, which I can throw on in less than a minute. I might look like Michelin Man but it's effective. Clip-on pannier baskets, instead of a backpack, ward off excessive sweat. Overall, I am a happy cyclist. What disappoints me is that so few people commute by bicycle in Dublin. Over the past two decades, cycling's lot has receded to a low ebb in Dublin (and indeed in most Irish towns and cities). Up to 40 per cent of commuters in Copenhagen cycle to work. By sad comparison, the share enjoyed by cycling in Dublin was a paltry 2 per cent in 2006. What is more shocking has been the dramatic fall in the number of pupils cycling to school. In 1986, a total of 23,635 primary-level pupils cycled to school. By 2006, that had fallen to just 4,000 (a decline of 83 per cent). This, despite the fact that 40 per cent of the 125,000 children in the greater Dublin area who are driven to school each day live less than two kilometres away.

Of course they would. Until they realised they would have to leave their car keys at home and start cycling to work. Then the excuses would inevitably start: it'll be cold and wet; I'll get sweaty; I might be hit by a car; I'll look ridiculous; my bike will be stolen; it's too far - the list of reasons why the vast majority of adults in this country have a almost pathological dislike of cycling is long. He believes many ""enlightened employers"" who are struggling to pay in excess of [euro]2,000 for parking spaces for their employees will be keen to take advantage of the move. ""I think the [euro]1,000 in tax relief is more than sufficient. You can get a good bike for [euro]350 and all the gear for another [euro]100. We do need to tip the balance for people who are considering taking their bikes to work, to give them that little bit of encouragement to leave their cars at home."" ""If you're cycling short distances and don't cycle like a madman then you won't need a shower when you get to work,"" [David Maher] says. ""These excuses are not real.

Cycling and safety: [CITY EDITION]: [CITY EDITION],"As for the DTO's ""cycle facilities"" manual, this is based on previous Dutch practice under Dutch conditions. It is our understanding that the Dutch system is based on the underlying assumption that motorists are automatically held liable in the event of car/bicycle collision, regardless of the actual circumstances. The average Dutch town bike has no gears and uses back-pedal brakes; the DTO assumed a Dutch design cyclist travelling at speeds of 7 to 13 m.p.h. Irish bicycles generally have 10 to 15 gears and Irish cycle commuters can be expected to reach speeds of 20 mph - i.e. 30 to 60 per cent faster than the speeds assumed by the design manual.

Part of the problem is it's grown so quickly, people are not used to the number of cyclists on the road, are losing it a bit with cyclists.

Dutch sport facing sexual abuse revelations: Renowned cyclist reveals how she suffered decades of abuse during career: Renowned cyclist reveals how she suffered decades of abuse during career,"  A hero to her own generation and a role model to those who've followed, she's someone to whom the Dutch sporting world has always listened. What she had to say last month, however, turned the public perception of her ""glittering career"" upside down. ""I doubted myself,"" De Vries wrote. ""I didn't say anything because I didn't want any fuss. And I was 30! I had a lot more life experience than my 18-year-old team-mates.""

"Where the bike is king: Cycling is the heartbeat of Flanders - from leisurely tours to the toughest of tests, writes Killian Doyle: Cycling is the heartbeat of Flanders - from leisurely tours to the toughest of tests, writes Killian Doyle","  It's their version of St Patrick's Day, except instead of Texan cheerleaders and Macnas floats, they send 200 of the planet's toughest athletes out to ride 240km on glorified farm tracks around the town of Oudenaarde, gurning up dozens of the famed local cobbled hills, known in Flemish as bergs or ' he llingen '. One look at them and you know why. Perhaps the most infamous is the Koppenberg, so-called because Flemish slang for cobblestones is kinderkoppen , or ""children's heads"". Coming round a tight corner, it rises up in front of you like a 600m long set of stairs. It is so steep - hitting a gradient of 22 per cent in the middle section - that it's a struggle to get up it at a crawl, never mind at race pace. And when the cobbles are wet, muddy or covered in wet leaves, forget about it. Of course, there's plenty of cycling action in Ghent too. I was fortunate enough to be there in November for the Six Days of Ghent, a race run on a rickety little indoor wooden track called 't Kuipke - literally ""little pot"", so called because it resembles one. The race sees riders zoom around the track at up to 70km/h on carbon bikes with fixed wheels and no brakes, often mere millimetres from the rider in front.

New Peugeot 3008 leads the push upmarket: Crossover offers foldable electric scooter or bicycle for park&#39;n&#39;ride option: Crossover offers foldable electric scooter or bicycle for park'n'ride option,"  The original 3008 cabin was a very comfortable and cosseting place but the new car's interior is exceptional for its class, which is dominated by the Hyundai Tucson. While I'm still caught up in the international launch hype I'm tempted to refer to Peugeot from now on as ""the formerly mainstream car company Peugeot"". Peugeot's new direction is built on solid foundations. The Peugeot Design Lab sub-division in recent years has devised some fantastic objects ranging from pepper mills to grand pianos - and there is even a Peugeot-styled helicopter. With the 3008, the lab's influence is very present and the piano key like interior dash switches are as cool as Mini's toggle switches. A mix of road surfaces from smooth autostrada, nice B roads and craggy country roads were tackled over two days in diesel- and petrol-powered 3008s and the experience was pleasant and comfortable despite riding on big 19-inch alloys. The 3008 has Peugeot's smallest steering wheel. Sitting below the i-cockpit instrument display the sporty wheel is slightly flattened at the bottom and top and it makes driving to the shops feel sporty. The automatic gearbox works well in the 3008 and features a new, and here we go again, beautifully-styled lever. A six-speed manual gearbox will be standard on Irish cars.",1834640287,"Nov 2, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 25

First, he refers to a series of levies - road tax, fuel tax and insurance costs - that apparently fund this subsidy. There has never been a ""road tax"" in Ireland. Instead we pay ""motor tax"". This is not a trivial distinction - ""road tax"" implies a levy on using the highway. Motor tax is a tax on using a mechanically propelled vehicle (whether on-road or off-road) and reflects the negative externalities associated with the use of such vehicles (primarily pollution). In any case, your letter-writer's construction of a ""them versus us"" scenario between motorists and cyclists is hard to sustain.

Revolutions in design: Designer Paul Smith recalls the glamour of cycling&#39;s golden era in his new book: Designer Paul Smith recalls the glamour of cycling's golden era in his new book,"  At times it is difficult to attach the term ""golden age"" to the sport of cycling when we consider how much of its gilding has always been corrupted by a perennial history of doping, be it alleged or well founded. One of the sport's greatest champions, Jacques Anquetil, did once say after all: 'You can't win the Tour de France on mineral water', and the eight-time major race winner was fairly unrepentant about the use of amphetamines in competition. 'But there's much more to it than that. As a child I loved the feeling of being on a bike so much that my first serious ambition was to be a professional rider. I probably wouldn't have been good enough, even if an accident when I was 17 removed the possibility. But for most of my life I've admired the skill and courage of the great riders of successive generations.' It's easy to understand how the kaleidoscope of colour and design in mid-century cycling would have inspired [Paul Smith] the fashionisto. In the post-war years cycling sponsors and teams or manufacturers such as Peugeot, Simplex, and Raleigh created beautiful kit, logos and artwork to match the sport's grandeur. It's sometimes forgotten that cyclists were the only sports people to have sponsors and logos on their kit during the 1950s and '60s. Many companies came on board to advertise their products, from coffee to cigarettes (one advertisement draws our attention to a lighter that works in the wind when on the bike), as well as well-known drinks such as Cinzano, Martini and Dubonnet.",1799302137,"Jun 25, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 6

Cyclists must stop peddling excuses for rule-breaking,"  Asked about the new figures, Ciarn Cuffe of the Green Party said cyclists should not break the law but emphasised that the imposition of fines on 600 cyclists in six months was ""on the high side"".

Cuffe added that he would like to see more focus on the ""vast number of cars routinely breaking speed limits"" and on the ignoramuses who park in cycle lanes. The other argument - and Cuffe used it - is that ""99 times out of 100, it is the cyclist who is going to be hurt in an accident"". This, of course, is true, and all the more reason for cyclists to adhere to the rules of the road, for their own safety as well as the safety and sanity of others. Cuffe further said that garda were parking on footpaths outside shops. ""Far too often they park in cycle lanes so they can nip into a local Centra. I don't say that lightly.

And if you've done the preparation - if you've been up most Irish hills with a 'Gap' in their name more times than you can count - the universality of cycling starts to offer real opportunities to move beyond these shores. The route varies because it follows the exact path of a stage of each year's tour, almost always in the Alps or the Pyrenees.

Sheep thrills: the hazards of cycling on rural roads: A cycle in Ireland&#39;s beautiful countryside may be just magical but ignore its many dangers at your peril: A cycle in Ireland's beautiful countryside may be just magical but ignore its many dangers at your peril,"  We're lucky to live in Ireland. The place is full of countryside. But before you pack your sandwiches and hurtle headlong into the hills, you must realise there are a few important differences between urban and rural cycling. Knowledge of these could save your life. Traffic: Sure, there's generally less traffic in the country than in towns and cities. Problem is, it's invariably travelling faster. And when those big metal things hit you, they really hurt. So don't be fooled by the quiet, seemingly abandoned road. At any second, a halfwit in a Subaru could come tearing around a corner and skittle you. Or you could be ploughing downhill, bum in the air like Chris Froome himself, only to impale yourself on one of those random torture devices Irish farmers seem to delight in hanging off the back of their tractors. Eyes and ears open at all times. Potholes: Despite our green and pleasant land boasting enough billiard table smooth motorways to transport the Chinese army, our backroad potholes are still the stuff of legend. Despite the recent general election and the flurry of pothole filling that invariably accompanies such plebiscites, they lurk around every bend, waiting to swallow you, bike and all. Or, failing that, give you a nasty puncture. And don't ever be tempted to ride through a puddle. For nine times out of 10 it'll have a pothole underneath it.

""This route would seamlessly connect the Grand Canal greenway to the south city's Georgian parklands via high-quality cycle infrastructure. If completed, a family will be able to cycle from Tallaght along the Dodder Greenway, which is currently being developed, to Grand Canal Dock, along the Grand Canal greenway to Mount Street Upper, and then all they way into Merrion Square, Stephen's Green or even the Iveagh Gardens, and never once have to cycle beside a moving car.""",1784008290,"Apr 26, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 4

But he believes the boom is now feeding itself. ""There wasn't even one dedicated bike shop in the town I grew up in. You had to get a catalogue and order what you wanted, so it was fairly exclusive in that regard, especially if you were trying to get children into it.

When you leave the house on a bike you know how long it will take you to get wherever you are going. As cyclists go, I'm a slow one.

Cycling is a punctual person's friend. 3 Flexidestrianism. One of the best things about cycling is that you don't have to choose between being a pedestrian and being a cyclist. You get to be both. For example, there's a notorious stretch as you climb the hill from St Patrick's Cathedral and approach several lanes of extremely busy traffic. If you want to cross over to head for Dame Street, you take your life and your bike in your hands. I've a friend who loves this challenge but this is where I turn flexidestrian, get off my bike, mount the pavement and walk across with the aid of the green man.

It differed from the dandy horse by having pedals attached to the front wheel, by which the cyclist powered the machine. Still pretty rudimentary, it had no brakes or gears and one imagines it earned the ""bone shaker"" nickname with some justification. 3 Things started to get weird with the ""high wheeler"" or ""penny farthing"", which appeared seven years later. The pedals were still attached directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. However, the front wheel was huge and the rider sat perched above it. With solid rubber tyres, it was far more comfortable than the Velocipede, though mounting it was notoriously difficult and dismounting presumably presented even more of a problem, particularly at speed. 8 The Velo Jaune is far from the most exciting or glamorous machine on this list.

Why the motorist and cyclist should be friends: Some basic courtesy and good manners from both car and bike users would greatly reduce road rage incidents: Some basic courtesy and good manners from both car and bike users would greatly reduce road rage incidents,"  Drivers and cyclists tend to give each other a hard time. Certainly, both groups regularly grumble and moan about each other's behaviour. Any driver can tell you tales of appalling behaviour on two wheels and the bikes users can counter with tales of their own. If it is wet at all then water will bead on a car's glass and reflect car lights and street lights. An unlit cyclist is invisible and therefore terrifying. Hi-viz gear is excellent, extra lights on helmets and bags are really useful but the absolute minimum is a proper light front and rear. Bikes are great on congested roads because they can usually move alongside vehicles and they don't get held up. It's a key attraction but remember you do not have a divine right not to be stuck in traffic. If cars are stationary then you may well have to be stationary too. If you can't progress without mounting a path or hitting a mirror then wait where you are.",1782028192,"Apr 20, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 14
"Talking about a revolution in popularity of cycling: City bikes schemes, rural greenways and bike-to-work scheme have kick-started boom in cycling activity: City bikes schemes, rural greenways and bike-to-work scheme have kick-started boom in cycling activity","  Three significant occurrences in the past seven years have turned cycling in Ireland into a more popular activity. They are the Dublin Bikes scheme in the city, the establishment of the Great Western Greenway in Mayo and the bike-to-work tax-relief scheme. In just a few short years cycling has become mainstream, with people cycling who never would have imagined themselves back on a bike. In Dublin the success of the Dublin Bikes scheme can be seen in the fact that there are more than 58,000 long-term subscribers, using 5,000 bikes dotted around the 102 stands in the city. Last year subscribers in Dublin made over 3.7 million journeys. The Coca-Cola sponsored bike scheme has spread to Cork, Galway and Limerick in the past two years. The progress of the planned coastal cycling route around Dublin Bay, the Sutton to Sandycove S2S cycle track, is still painfully slow. While work may be going on behind the scenes, very little is evident. The proposed East Coast Greenway, which could link Drogheda to Arklow, is still a long way in the future. The Carlingford to Omeath greenway opened last year and is a lovely cycle along the lough shore.",1782028197,"Apr 20, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 18

Legacy of a tax scheme that really worked: The cycle to work incentive means bicycles and extra accessories can often be bought for half the full cost: The cycle to work incentive means bicycles and extra accessories can often be bought for half the full cost,"  The tax break can be attached to new bicycles or ""pedelecs"", or battery-powered bikes, which require some effort on the part of a cyclist. It can also be applied to bicycle helmets, bells, lights, panniers, locks, pumps, and puncture repair kits and reflective clothing and rain gear - in short everything that an aspiring cyclist could possibly need to get on their bike. Upfront payment Given the nature of the scheme - and the fact that it involves an upfront payment from an employer and then monthly deductions over a maximum of 12 months - both employee and employer have to sign up. Once an employer agrees to pay an agreed supplier, all the cyclist needs to do is visit that shop, select what they need after which the shop invoices the employer directly for the gear. A decent bicycle including lights and reflective gear, on the other hand, will cost 350 - once the tax incentives are factored in. Assuming it is not stolen, a [Sutton]-based cyclist will save themselves just under 4,000 over the course of three years while a converted motorist will save more than twice that amount.",1782028243,"Apr 20, 2016",Irish Times,2016, 2

A Tour de France talk that neatly sidesteps the issue of doping: An interview with Froome was too short to gain many insights into cycling: An interview with Froome was too short to gain many insights into cycling,"  Recovery between stages, however, is crucial, which is why Team Sky brings all their own pillows and mattresses from hotel to hotel: ""So you basically get the same night's sleep, for every night on the Tour.

But it's the accumulation of all these little things put together."" During this summer's Tour there were plenty of people wondering about the ""marginal gains"" which contributed to [Chris Froome]'s crushing ride up the La Pierre Saint Martin, on the second Tuesday of the race, to take charge of the Tour; also to his Team Sky escort to the finish on Plateau de Beille two days later. There, and despite riding into a headwind, both Froome and teammate Geraint Thomas eclipsed several of the previous fastest climbs up the 15.8km ascent, including [Lance Armstrong]'s best from 2002, plus several other rides achieved at the height of cycling's doping problem. ""For 10 months of the year, it's a way of life. You're looking at everything that passes your lips, your sleep, the amount of time you're actually standing on your feet.

We need to tackle dangers facing cyclists: Too little is being done to reduce the hazards posed by cars to road users: Too little is being done to reduce the hazards posed by cars to road users,"  Cycling advocates maintain much of the recent commentary on bicycling behaviour falls into the category of ""dangerising"" cycling - that is, misjudging how dangerous the activity is and failing to recognise the real sources of danger. The Irish Times reports the rise in cycle fatalities between 2013 (five) and 2014 (12). While campaigners are undoubtedly saddened by this increase, we need to take a longer-term perspective to understand trends. Policing and road safety efforts must be weighted towards slowing down motorised vehicles. This is particularly pertinent given that an increasing proportion of newly registered cars are sports utility vehicles (SUVs), with greater masses, wider bodies, higher front ends and low ""Euro NCAP"" safety ratings (used to estimate the severity of injuries caused to pedestrians from front-end impacts). It is no wonder the number of children cycling to primary school has decreased dramatically over the past 20 years - in 1991, some 22,400 children cycled to primary school; by 2011, it was just over 6,200. Further, while the provision of cycle lanes expanded substantially over the past 20 years (with very mixed quality of designs), the problem of ""fly-parking"" on cycle tracks is remarkably common.",1702324928,"Aug 10, 2015",Irish Times,2015, 14

And he was given that derogation. Normally the rule is the transfer between one team and another can only be done between June 1st and June 25th every year.

Astana backing Astana is also the team of reigning Tour de France champion, Italy's Vincenzo Nibali, although that's not the only reason they're so keen to hold on to their UCI licence. Astana is financed by a coalition of state-owned companies from Kazakhstan (and thus named after its capital city).

"For all dark tales, bravery of pro cycling endures","  I go cycling for the sheer pleasure of it. It's all part of the old etiquette of the sport: ride on, don't look back, deal with the consequences later. ""Put me back on my bike,"" cried Tom Simpson, after collapsing in the 1967 Tour de France, just 1.5km from the summit of Mont Ventoux. Simpson had ridden himself to the point of oblivion, although what the roadside medics didn't realise was that he'd also consumed several shots of amphetamines and brandy before the climb - a fatal combination, as it turned out, as he was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Now, [Alberto Contador] is far from squeaky clean on the doping front (he was stripped of his 2011 Giro title, after testing positive for clenbuterol the previous summer), but there's an undeniable bravery about him too. In last year's Tour de France, Contador crashed on the descent from Col du Platzerwasel, on stage 10, then rode on for another 20km before realising he'd broken his left tibia. A month later he started in the Vuelta a Espaa and ended up winning. What has made this year's Corsa Rosa additionally fascinating, along with the hardship, is the friendship - and nowhere was that more evident than in Tuesday's stage 10, into Forli. Richie Porte's puncture, 5km from the finish, couldn't have come at a worse time, so the Team Sky rider - one of the main challengers to Contador - gladly accepted a wheel from fellow Australian Simon Clarke, even though Clarke rides for the Orica- Green Edge team.",1682516817,"May 23, 2015",Irish Times,2015, 8

It has a slightly shabby chic element to it, with the emphasis most definitely on chic, such as the Hotel Carris where we spent the first night of our week long cycling holiday from Porto to Coimbra. Located in the historic centre of Porto, overlooking the river, this magnificent granite building has been restored with that urban stark chic that is far from ostentatious, but oozing with quiet confidence. As we cycled out of Porto, along the river boardwalk on the southside, within minutes we had entered a world of fishermen, young and old, casting their lines from the river shore. With only 30kms to cycle before our next bed for the night, in Furadouro, we didn't feel in any way hurried as we paused to take in the virtually unchanged with time vistas. Such as the petite port town of Afurada, where women, old and young, were either washing the daily catch in giant tubs, or hanging out their own washing to dry along the shore. A shore where, when you pedal on just half a kilometre, a state of the art yachty marina welcomed a very different clientele. Cruising along in this carbon free manner is also suited to stretches like the Reserva Natural Local do Esturio do Douro, a wetland that precedes the coast, and where birdwatching is prolific, with everything from falcons to flamingos flying in to rest at this briny birders' paradise. And after the brine, the beach. Or Praia, as they call it in Portugal. At each beach, there is a map that looks a little like it is for a subway except, along this line, all the stops represent beaches rather than stations. Praia de Mirimar is one of the showstoppers, with a chapel built on the rocks just a little out to sea, so that you can walk to it at low tide.

This is the result of the ongoing co-operation of landowners and initially the work of community and rural development bodies, supplemented more recently by local authorities, Filte Ireland funding, the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe and State initiatives such as the community employment schemes, rural social schemes, the walks scheme and the network of rural recreation officers, with technical and advisory back-up from the Irish Sports Council and the National Trails Office. If TDs like [Robert Dowds] want to help, they need to deal with issues such as were raised by Tadgh Foghlu (December 20th), concerning the often open hostility to initiatives to develop an adequate trail network on publicly owned property. Squatters who want to take over publicly owned routes like disused rail lines or canal and river navigation towpaths need to be dealt with firmly by lawmakers and politicians alike. The disused rail line from Claremorris to Collooney is disappearing a piece at a time behind post and rail fences and barbed wire. Robert Dowds should try to deal with these problems, and not spend his time chasing rainbows. Rural tourism can be the saviour of rural communities, if it is sustainable and well planned, but only if it has the support of the local people who will eventually benefit from it.",1639159112,"Dec 23, 2014",Irish Times,2014, 13

And will Paul Kimmage get a chance to see the bright side?","  Obsessives are the stuff of often weirdly compelling television. Take the parents in Child Genius (Channel 4, Monday). The series, back for a second year, follows 15 children taking part in a gruelling, pointless competition run by British Mensa to find the UK's Child Genius of the Year. ""Child"" is in the title, but it's all about the parents. They're the ones you watch and remember - pushy, terrifyingly confident - clinging to their children's IQ scores as if the numbers have any relevance in the real world. Shosana, mother of a hot-housed nine-year-old, Aliyah - ""I'm smarter than her. She's not profoundly gifted, as I was,"" says mum - makes it easy to be all judgy and self-righteous, which is the desired response to these cleverly edited parenting-themed programmes.

""Can you find a way to forgive yourself?"" murmers Shosana, a psychologist (yes, really), to her sobbing child. It's not the smartest way to reassure a child you've set up for a public failure.

May they continue to be a role model for other road users. - Yours, etc, Sir, - I agree with the sentiments expressed by Simon O'Connor (June 13th) about cyclists on footpaths and their arrogance when confronted by pedestrians about breaking the law.

Even those lanes that are usable are frequently filled with uneven surfaces and road debris, including broken glass, a major hazard to bicycle tyres. Many ""designated cycle lanes"" share footpaths with pedestrians, inviting conflict and accidents unless both groups of users rigidly confine themselves to their designated lanes, thereby limiting the amount of footpath available for walkers.",1537454680,"Jun 20, 2014",Irish Times,2014, 17

Overall, 38 per cent of people identified Mastercard as an official 2014 partner - not far behind the 42 per cent scored by actual sponsor Visa.
